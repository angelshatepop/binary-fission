<h3><i><center>keep in mind:<center></i></h3>
  the repo as of now is simply a collection of organized src code without anything external but my own solo-developer insanity.
eventually, this will repo will have a massive change in architecture to ensure successful implementation of external inclusions such as:
<<ul>
  <li>releases + packages</li>
  <li>github workflows/actions</li>
  <li>language bridging (rust -> py)</li>
  <li>security</li>
  <li>project managment</li>
  <li>virtual machine valid executables</li>
</ul>
